Explode Into Sharks

An addon for Garry's Mod 13 which causes things to explode into sharks. Once I slammed a racquetball into a florescent light and my roommate asked "What would you have done if that just exploded into sharks?", trying to say "shards" and "sparks" at once.

I was immediately intrigued by the mental images evoked by his mispronunciation, and decided to use Gmod to bring the idea to life. Enjoy!
